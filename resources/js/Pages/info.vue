        Your mystery, if you choose to accept it, is to participate in a series
        of matches, racing against a single opponent per round in short to
        medium length goals.
      </p>

      <p>
        Agents are likely to encounter games they've never seen or played
        before, or have never even heard of. The goals will be for games that
        are not revealed until moments before the race actually begins. But an
        agent of your caliber is ready for surprises in exotic locales, are you
        not?
      </p>

      <p>
        Victory will come to the agent not with the most experience, but the
        agent with the ability to adapt to unexpected circumstances without
        getting shaken or stirred.
      </p>

      <h2>Spy Gadgets to get you Equipped</h2>
      <p>
        Naturally, agent double-oh, we won't be sending you into the field
        unprepared. We've prepared a download containing the latest in
        state-of-the-art retro gaming emulators that should have you prepared
        for the widest variety of circumstances. I suggest you pick these up
        even if you have your own emulators, just to minimize any surprises in
        the field.

      <p>
        Sometimes, however, you'll need to work with equipment procured in the
        field. When this happens, you'll be provided everything you need by one
        of our expertly trained race moderators, including instructions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, while optional, you may wish to procure
        <a href="https://joytokey.net/en/" target="_blank">Joy2Key</a>, an
        ingenious little program that will allow you to use a controller for
        games designed for a keyboard. This could save your life in a close
        shave, double-oh!
      </p>

      <h2>Communications</h2>
      <p>
        Naturally, we'll be monitoring your progress in the field to determine
        your success or failure. First, you'll need a Twitch account, which you
        may already have. Second, you'll need IRC, which is where official race
        communications will occur. HexChat is a good candidate, and you can
        follow this online guide to configure it for access to SpeedRunsLive.
        Third, you must go to your VOD settings in Twitch and enable "Store past
        broadcasts". Failure to do so will result in expulsion, excommunication,
        execution, and possibly even extemporisation.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have any difficulty with this step, your fellow agents will happy
        to assist you if you only ask. Just don't wait to do this right before
        starting a mission, our moderators are risking their lives out in the
        field!

      <h2>Training</h2>
      <p>
        While your missions will strictly be one-on-one, other agents are
        welcome to join other matches for fun or experience. This is strongly
        encouraged, to ensure our agents are trained and ready when their own
        missions start.

              After registration closes, you'll learn which of Heff E. Trooper's
              agents you'll be up against. We recommend contacting those agents
              as soon as possible to arrange a time to battle. One that is
              convenient for both agents, naturally. Please plan for each match
              to take up to two hours, to account for setup time and variation
              in agent skill level, although the actual race is intended to take
              between 20 and 60 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
              You'll have at least three days per round to play each match.

              >
              to plan your race schedule, and schedule your matches with your
              opponent as soon as possible. If the opposing agent has gone AWOL,
              contact a moderator at your earliest opportunity to arrange for
              assistance, which may include an asynchronous race held in the
              strictest of secrecy.
            </p>
            <p>
              You are welcome to keep arranging matches against enemy agents
              ahead of schedule, so there is no need to wait after your next
              opponent is revealed.

              When you and your opponent are prepared for their date with
              destiny, you must use the top-secret codeword @GIVEGAME in the
              discord to identify yourself to one of our moderator field
              operators.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once both agents have begun Twitch Stream Transmissions, the game,
              goal, download and instructions will be provided. Quickly, but
              thoroughly, read the instructions and set up the game to prepare
              for play. These instructions will not self-destruct, so you may
              wish to keep them on-hand for reference before and during the
              race.
            </p>
            <p>
              In some situations, you may discover you have been assigned a
              mission in a game with which you are already familiar. If this
              happens, you may inform a moderator and have another game selected
              to maximize the surprise and the fun of the race, although this is
              encouraged but not required. We here at M-FH feel that it is good
              form to ensure both agents are on equally unfamiliar footing when
              competing.

          <v-expansion-panel-content>
            <p>
              Our agents work alone, in the utmost of secrecy. For this reason,
              you must not view your opponents stream or rebroadcast nor receive
              any type of guidance from your stream chat or any external source.
              We recommend hiding the chat to keep your focus sniper-like on
              your own mission. Furthermore, the moderator provided instructions
              is the only information you are permitted to use. Walkthroughs,
              instruction manuals, and any other documents are strictly
              classified as top-secret and forbidden during mission performance.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the event of a bug, crash, error, or any other unexpected
              change outside of mission parameters, please notify your Moderator
              Field Agent at the earliest opportunity, then attempt to continue
              the mission if possible. The Moderator will provide assistance if
              possible, which may include adjusting time to compensate for the
              glitch, redrawing the race, or possibly no change at all.
            </p>

              for the amusement and education of your peers, with race
              commentary. This is completely discretionary, and subject to the
              availability of our Restreamer Field Agents. If you wish for a
              restream, it is recommended to not only schedule your matches
              early, but notify restreamers of your desired race time to
              maximize the liklihood of a televised match. You always did have a
              flair for the dramatic, double-oh.

          <v-expansion-panel-content>
            <p>
              The first agent to successfully complete the goal as directed in
              the instructions provided by the moderator (possibly adjusted for
              bugs or crashes) will be declared the victor and advance to the
              next mission. The agent who finishes second will be reassigned to
              work undercover in the lower bracket. If an agent is bested again
              while in the lower bracket, they will be recognized for their
              contribution to their country and then honorably discharged from
              the tournament. Sadly, two strikes and you are out, unlike in that
              American baseball game.
            </p>
            <p>
              Discharged agents are still welcome to join any and all other
              missions they have time for, although these will no longer impact
              their rank.
            </p>
            <p>
              Missions are carefully tuned by our Q&A team to take 60 minutes or
              less, but mishaps are known to happen. In the event that a race
              takes longer by dint of player skill, unexpected game mechanics,
              or an unfortunate mishap involving a crate and a bear trap, there
              will be a hard cutoff at 90 minutes. We just don't have the budget
              to pay for overtime, double-oh. Whichever agent has made the most
              progress towards completing the mission will be awarded the
              victory. Lost progress will not be counted against you, so there
              will never be a penalty for fighting to the end! In the event of a
              draw, the agent that reached the draw point first will be awarded
              the victory! Further tie-breakers will be chosen at the
              moderator's discretion.
            </p>
            <p>
              If both agents complete the mission in less than 15 minutes, the
              race will be nullified and redrawn unless both agents wish for the
              result to stand.

            <p>
              The final eight agents remaining on the active duty roster will be
              invited to participate in the Top 8 broadcast. This will be a full
              weekend event, rebroadcast on the GamesDoneQuick twitch channel to
              a sizable audience. Agents will be expected to be available for
              the full duration; if you anticipate ranking in the Top 8 but will
              be unable to participate, please communicate with one of our
              Moderator Field Agents to arrange a solution.
            </p>
            <p>
              The top 4 will all be best of 3 matches, with a new game drawn for
              each match. Grand finals will not follow the traditional double
              elimination structure; both remaining agents will only play one
              best of 5 match, regardless of the outcome. The undefeated agent
              going into grand finals will automatically have a one-point lead,
              meaning they must only win twice while the lower bracket agent
              must win three times to win the tournament.
            </p>
            <p>
              The final, victorious agent will have thwarted Heff E. Trooper and
              earned the praise of their grateful countryfolk.
